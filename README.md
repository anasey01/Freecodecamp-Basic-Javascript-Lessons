# FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Challenge

Here's my Solution to Freecodecamp's Basic Algorigthm challenge


## Why I got into Web Development ?
I've been familiar with computing since I was 13. The most I ever did on computer was farmiliarize myself with its interface. I was so good with it that at age 14 - 15 I was already helping my siblings with assignments on the web, typing on Microsoft Word application, Creating basic execl spread sheets and understood how to make a powerpoint presentation (Although, never had to cause I had no use for it as at that time).

I started been inquisitive and wanted to know how those applications I had been using to solve most problems that seemed prominet in my life then. I though, if I could just make more applications that can help more and more people be productive, wouldn't it be a better world?

Thus, my desire to study computer sciences was born! (I'm 28 now and haven't actualized that just yet). My pursit to studing computer sciences in Nigerian university was sort of hectic as there were a little complications here and there. But something else seemed to have a greater motivating power in my career pursit, "My Desire To Understand Why People Behave The Way They Do".

I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Psychology from the University of Lagos, Nigeria - It's been a remarkable journey for me so far and grateful that I made this career choice, however, my deisire for latest technologies never quenched. 

Here I am in a self tutoring phase, actively learning to becoming a Web Developer. Need I saw, I'm also pursuing a Masters Degree in Computer Sciences. What a blend of "People" (Psychology) and "Computing" (Computer Sciences).
